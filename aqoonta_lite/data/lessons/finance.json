      "heading": "Understanding Inflation",
      "content": "Inflation refers to a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money â€“ a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy."
